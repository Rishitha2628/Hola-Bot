  Hola Bot is an AGV(Automated Grounded Vehicle) used for painting. This is developed during the E-yantra 2022 Competition.

  The AGV has been simulated on Gazebo and ROS Noetic. The bot has three wheeledd holonomic drive. Wrench data type is used to implement the Inverse Kinematics on the bot to know the position and orientation of the bot. Two PID controllers were used for Force and Torque control on the wheels.
